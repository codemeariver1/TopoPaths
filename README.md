Goal: Determine how many topopaths there are in an arbitrary directed graph

Purpose: "A topopath is an ordering of vertices that simultaneously corresponds to a valid path in a graph and a valid 
topological sort. More than anything, this program should serve as a relatively short critical thinking exercise. You will 
gain experience reading graphs from an input file, representing them computationally, and writing graph theory algorithms. 
You will also solidify your understanding of topological sorts, sharpen your problem solving skills, and get some practice 
at being clever, because your solution to this problem must be O(|V|2)." - Prof. Sean Szumlanski
